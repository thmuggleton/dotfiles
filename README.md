# dotfiles

This repository contains configuration files for bash, tmux and vim.

There is also a script to symlink the files in this repository to the user's
home directory.  If files with the same name already exist, the script prompts
for confirmation before overwriting them with symlinks.

From the root of the project, invoke the script to create symlinks like this:
```
./create-symlinks.sh
```
